# Price Notifier

**Things To Do** (*delete after completion of project*)

- A web extension that will retrieve the link itself from webpage, currently amazon and will put the item into the extension for a single user.

- The item gets stored in the json file and gives a popup in the extension icon itself if there is a decrease/increase in the price.

-Note: item_price might increase or decrease. The customer will recieve popup if the current_price decreases or increases from the initial item_price of item stored.
