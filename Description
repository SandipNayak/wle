Basically the project aims at notifying the user
if there is a price drop in any item he/she wants to buy from any online shopping website.

But currently we are just focussing on a single user
i.e only one user at a time and the shopping website is selected as Amazon for now.

We are making it into a complete web extension that creates a wishlist in the database
and notifies any sort of price changes for multiple products as well as multiple websites.
